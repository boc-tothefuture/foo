				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today in IT, the need to maintain security and governance is often at odds with the imperative to move quickly. <a href="https://chefconf.chef.io/2016/" target="_blank">At this year’s ChefConf</a>, compliance and security were topics of much discussion among presenters and attendees alike. Enterprise IT teams are adopting a new way to deliver experiences for customers safely <b><i>and </i></b>quickly: by expressing compliance and security as code. This brings regulatory protocols into the build process earlier, allowing teams to deliver infrastructure and applications at velocity.</p>
<p>We caught up with <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG3OZologLU">Michael Hedgpeth, Senior Software Architect at NCR Corporation</a>, to get his thoughts on how to marry these seemingly conflicting priorities.</p>
<blockquote><p>The reality is, there needs to be a partnership [between security and dev teams] and the only way that they’re going to be able to audit at scale and velocity is if they automate that audit. Our security people have really gotten that and are getting behind <a href="https://www.chef.io/inspec/">Inspec</a>,” said Hedgpeth. “But that does fundamentally change their organization from that of spreadsheets and manual checking or scanning with software to coding, checking things in, and being a part of the development pipeline just like everybody else is.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are few organizations that understand this need to bring compliance into the pipeline better than SAP NS2, which specializes in providing the SAP portfolio to federal organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/A3SimQnbcjg">Cheerag Patel, DevOps Manager at SAP NS2, says his organization meets this need by looking at the workflow holistically</a> and incorporating compliance into the process from day one. Approaching compliance as an endpoint can cause trouble because if you build environments and then add compliance, those environments will often break because they weren’t designed with security in mind. Instead, Patel recommends implementing security controls at the outset of the workflow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We enjoyed meeting so many members of the community at the <a href="https://live.awsevents.com/">AWS Summit in New York City</a> last week!</p>
<p>The Summit started Wednesday, August 10th with a full day of sessions including one on Securing Cloud Workloads with DevOps Automation. There was also an awesome startup simulation where participants acted as a DevOps lead.</p>
<p>Thursday, August 11th began with a <a href="https://live.awsevents.com/index.html">keynote</a> from Amazon.com CTO Werner Vogels. He presented with guests from Lyft,  Airtime, and Comcast. This led into lightning talks and breakout sessions covering CI/CD, microservices, security, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our team of twelve awesome Chefs, were in the expo hall fueling the love of Chef with plenty of t-shirts, stickers, and great conversations. We met hundreds of attendees, from people who are just starting to think about automation, to advanced Chef users who have been part of our community for years. Our booth was full of great energy throughout the day with folks interested in learning about our new product, <a href="https://www.chef.io/automate/">Chef Automate</a>. In particular, I heard many conversations about the benefits of the <a href="https://docs.chef.io/workflow.html">Workflow feature</a>. People were also excited to learn about our open source projects: <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat</a> for application automation and <a href="https://www.chef.io/inspec/" target="_blank">InSpec</a> for compliance and security automation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The Event</h4>
<p>Chef was a proud sponsor of <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-portland/welcome/">DevOpsDays Portland</a> on August 9th &amp; 10th at the Oregon Convention Center. A sold-out, diverse crowd gathered for keynotes, presentations, lightning talks, and open spaces to learn, discuss, and promote all things DevOps.</p>
<h4>The Presentations</h4>
<p>DevOpsDays Portland was in full-swing by 9:15am when <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower">Kelsey Hightower</a> took the stage to talk about No Ops and what it really means. The next two mornings saw presentations from influential and forward-thinking members of our community, including two of my own colleagues, <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-portland/program/nell-shamrell-harrington/">Nell Shamrell-Harrington</a> and <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-portland/program/jennifer-davis/">Jennifer Davis</a>. Topics ranged from DevOps history, managing burnout, how security teams can be more approachable, monitoring, and everything in-between.</p>
<h4>The Food</h4>
<p>Because it’s Portland, lunch was provided by a variety of PDX’s most beloved food trucks. Participants’ palates were delighted by Hawaiian fusion (808 Grinds), latin american (Fuego), Korean fusion (Koi Fusion), and gluten-free world fusion (Thrive). The two I had the pleasure of eating at were delicious and fueled me up for the action-packed second half of the conference.</p>
<h4>Ignite Sessions</h4>
<p>Immediately following lunch were the lightning talk Ignite sessions. For those not familiar, Ignite talks are 5 minutes long consisting of 20 slides that advance every 15 seconds. I felt this format was a fun way to digest information quickly and left me thinking, “why didn’t I submit an Ignite talk?!” My colleague <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-portland/program/jj-asghar/">JJ Asghar</a> did a presentation on being an introvert. As an extrovert, I really enjoyed hearing how an introvert deals with conferences.</p>
<h4>Open Spaces</h4>
<p>After the Ignite sessions came my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/">Open Spaces</a>. As expected, a wide variety of topics were suggested and scheduled during Open Spaces. At DevOpsDays Portland, we had three time slots consisting of seven different sessions. I particularly enjoyed the database automation discussions and the AMA (ask me anything) sessions.</p>
<h4>Chef Booth</h4>
<p>Following Open Spaces, the days were concluded with one final main-room talk per day and closing remarks. I can’t say much about these closing sessions because I was serving booth duty both days during this time.</p>

<h4>Evening Event</h4>
<p>Tuesday evening, our friends at <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> hosted a great party in their downtown Portland office, colloquially known as “Big Pink”. High atop, Big Pink provided the perfect location for a community party. Breath-taking views coupled with drinks, snacks, games, and interesting, intelligent conversation provided the perfect setting for the celebration.</p>
<h4>Wrap-up and What’s Next</h4>
<p>I really enjoyed DevOpsDays Portland and thought the format and the topics were well thought-out. I loved the Ignite talks and open spaces and could have done a whole extra day of just those. The event was very professionally run and I got the chance to have some awesome conversations with amazing people in the DevOps community.</p>
<p>If you’re in the Portland area, I invite you to join me on August 23rd for the <a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/event/docker-pdx/">Docker PDX Meetup</a>. I’ll be speaking about <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat</a> and ways you can contribute to our open-source platform.</p>
<p>Outside of Portland? Check out our full <a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/events/">calendar of events</a> to find out when we’ll be in your area.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were delighted to welcome so many of you to ChefConf 2016 this year, particularly the newest members of our community: the Habitat users. We saw incredible interest in Habitat at ChefConf such that we had to repeat all the sessions the next day, due to overflow crowds.</p>
<p>If you weren&#8217;t able to make it to ChefConf &#8212; or just weren&#8217;t able to make it into the overcrowded Habitat session rooms &#8212; we&#8217;re posting all the videos here this week. In the first of the sessions, Joshua Timberman, Software Engineer at Chef, provides an introduction to Habitat. Joshua spends some time talking about where we&#8217;ve been with application packaging, portability, and management, and why Habitat was invented.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>What is Chef Automate?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.chef.io/automate/">Chef Automate</a> is our new approach to scaling up the use of automation across your organization. It builds on our open-source projects: <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/">Chef</a> for infrastructure and cloud automation, <a href="https://www.chef.io/inspec/">InSpec</a> for compliance automation, and the newly released <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat</a> for application automation.</p>
<p>Moving from manual processes to automated ones, incorporating compliance tests into your deployment pipeline, or better managing your applications throughout their lifecycle all present similar obstacles. With Chef Automate, your team has one product that brings end-to-end visibility, compliance, and a unified workflow to your organization’s deployment pipelines.</p>
<h4>Try Chef Automate</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.chef.io/automate/">Start your 30-day trial</a> and transform your company into a highly collaborative, software-driven organization with Chef Automate as the engine. This will allow you access to premium content, world-class support, and tools you need for mission critical service.</p>
<h4>See a Demo of Chef Automate</h4>
<p>Watch this recorded webinar to learn about the different capabilities of Chef Automate and how it unifies Chef, Inspec, and Habitat into a comprehensive DevOps strategy for any company in today&#8217;s digital world.</p>
<h5>We&#8217;ll show you how:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Workflow provides a common pipeline for governance and dependency management.</li>
<li>Visibility gives you deep insight into what’s happening in your organization, including serverless chef-client runs and data from multiple Chef servers.</li>
<li>Compliance enables automated compliance assessments as part of your workflow pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Q&amp;A From Live Presentation</h4>
<p><strong>Q: <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Where does Test Kitchen fit into the Workflow feature of Chef Automate?&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Where does Test Kitchen fit into the Workflow feature of Chef Automate?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Workflow pipelines are driven by what is defined in the underlying build cookbook. As an example, for delivering a cookbook through workflow one would use the delivery-truck build-cookbook which would run all of the included inspec tests that you write with your cookbook.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">Workflow pipelines are driven by what is defined in the underlying build cookbook.

<p>A: <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The Chef Automate licensing is designed to simplify the licensing that was used for the Chef product line historically. If you have\u00a0previous licensing currently it's best to reach out to your account manager or sales@chef.io for how to get started with Chef Automate.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:769,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0}">The Chef Automate licensing is designed to simplify the licensing that was used for the Chef product line historically.

<p>A: <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Compliance includes several InSpec profiles out of the box.

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DevOps is the embodiment of process and improvements that other industries have learned, applied to IT and how companies can deliver value to customers.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Nirmal Mehta, Chief Technologist, Booz Allen Hamilton</span></i></p>

In order to do that, you need backend tools that provide stability and the ability to push things out quickly.” &#8211; </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGJkhuRlvTo&amp;index=5&amp;list=PL11cZfNdwNyPo_EEgCGDe9mrUlMtTf361"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veresh Sita, CIO, Alaska Airlines</span></i></a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why DevOps is the key to customer experience?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Delivering on the final product is key. Your job’s not done if the customer can’t accomplish what they want. If the customer can’t do it, it doesn’t matter if your section of the code was good. The customer experience is all that matters.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Adam Mikeal, </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of Information Technology at the College of Architecture, Texas A&amp;M University</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits to being part of an open source community?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Open source is important because it’s a community practice. It is building a people who are invested in driving a whole industry forward, not just our individual silos of information or product areas.”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Naomi Reeves, Senior Engineer, Target</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When something is broken you want to be able to look under the hood and fix it. That’s a key factor in open source. It helps you think better, contribute back to the community and fix bugs. It allows the community to experiment and build things &#8211; like GitHub &#8211; that didn’t exist 10 years ago.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Matt Medeiros, Systems Engineer</span></i></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d like to announce that </span><a href="https://www.hpe.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (HPE) is now part of the </span><a href="https://www.chef.io/partners/cookbooks/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Chef Partner Cookbook Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. They have certified the </span><a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/oneview"><span style="font-weight: 400">OneView</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ilo"><span style="font-weight: 400">iLO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> cookbooks which provide interfaces via Chef to two flagship HPE products.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hpe.com"><img class="alignnone" src="https://i1.wp.com/edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2015/11/hpe_pri_grn_pos_rgb.jpg?resize=345%2C194" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/oneview"><span style="font-weight: 400">OneView cookbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> allows users to configure and manage HPE hardware using OneView’s unified API.  Using this cookbook, users specify the types of infrastructure to be configured (e.g., an HPE server blade), and the way they need to be configured (e.g., attached to this storage pool and connected to these network sets). The cookbook allows complex infrastructure configurations to be fully automated without requiring complex choreography across servers, storage and networking APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ilo"><span style="font-weight: 400">iLO cookbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> allows users to configure the Integrated Lights-Out remote server management layer for HPE Servers. You can easily apply configuration across your fleet of servers, taking the headache out of managing your data center. It also provides a mechanism for consolidating configuration information from the iLOs locally or on the Chef server, giving you visibility and reporting capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Chef Partner Cookbook Program is a collaboration between Chef and the vendor to help validate cookbooks in our public supermarket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Congratulations to Hewlett Packard Enterprise!</span></p>
